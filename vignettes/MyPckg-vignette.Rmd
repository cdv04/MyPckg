## Vignette Info

This is the vignette of my package named , as a very original way, "MyPckg".

This package permits to analyse data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

This package permits to obtain summary statistics about juries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes and to map them.

In order to install the package, you have to use the following line.

```{r package, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(MyPckg) 

```

## Functions of the package

This package contains 5 functions :

* fars_read()
* make_filename()
* fars_read_years()
* fars_summarize_years()
* fars_map_state ()

You can  obtain help for these following functions using the following synthax.
```{r help synthax, echo=TRUE}

? fars_read()
```



## Example

### Obtaining numbers of fatal injuries by month

You can obtain the number of fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes by month, for years 2013 and 2015 using the following lines :

```{r exemple, echo=TRUE}

MySummary<- fars_summarize_years(list(2013,2015))
kable(MySummary)

```


### Mapping the fatal injuries

You can map the injuries in the first state during year 2013  using the following command line
```{r, fig.show='hold'}


fars_map_state(1,2013)
