Project Building R package (Coursera, JHU)


This package is a project of the "Building R package coure" from Coursera and JHU.
his package permits to analyse data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes.

It permits to obtain summary statistics about juries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes and to map them.


I passed it to travais but I had 1 error, and don't know how to add the log to the repository.
